# Tree_Simulator
These are the files I used to simulate my tree at CCG using pyvolve, tested with iq-tree. Other software is referenced by the bash script but you can install it if you want. 
I believe the only referenced external software is Dr. Michael Campana's BaitsTools (https://github.com/campanam/BaitsTools), save for iq-tree, which was used to analyze the resulting fasta files.
IQ-tree is hosted on ubuntu package manager and an online version is available at http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at/. Parameters for analyzing data simulated with these python scripts are located in the bash file in the form I used.
Note that I changed the normalization and sanity steps in the pyvolve source code; these likely won't run properly on other people's machines. This is just for me.
