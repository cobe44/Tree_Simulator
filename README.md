# Tree_Simulator
These are the files I used to simulate my tree at CCG using pyvolve, tested with iq-tree. Other software is referenced by the bash script but you can install it if you want. (iq-tree is on ubuntu package manager) Note that I changed the normalization and sanity steps in the pyvolve source code; these likely won't run properly on other people's machines. This is just for me.
